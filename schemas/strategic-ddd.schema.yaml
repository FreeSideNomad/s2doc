  BFFInterface:
    type: object
    description: |
      Concrete BFF interface implementation for a specific bounded context accessed by a BFF.
      This represents the actual REST API or integration interface that a BFF exposes to its
      client, combining data from the referenced bounded context with potential data from other
      contexts. This is the implementation artifact of a bff_scope.

best_practices:
  strategic:
    - "Start by identifying domains and subdomains"
    - "Define bounded contexts based on linguistic boundaries"
    - "Use context mapping to make integration explicit"
    - "Invest most in core domain"
    - "Buy or outsource generic subdomains"
    - "One BFF per client type (web, iOS, Android, partner API)"
    - "BFF aggregates data from MULTIPLE bounded contexts"
    - "Owned by frontend team (Conway's Law)"
    - "BFF contains presentation logic, NOT business logic"
    - "Use hybrid approach: API Gateway upstream for cross-cutting concerns, BFFs downstream for client-specific orchestration"
    - "BFF delegates to application services, does not access databases directly"
    - "Separate request/response DTOs in BFF from API command/query records"
    - "Use API Gateway for: cross-cutting concerns (auth, SSL, rate limiting, logging)"
    - "Use BFF for: client-specific orchestration, data aggregation, format transformation"
    - "Use BOTH: API Gateway upstream + multiple BFFs downstream (common pattern)"
